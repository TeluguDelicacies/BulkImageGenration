        "GLASS_JAR_TEMPLATE": "PRE-GENERATION REFERENCE CHECK (MANDATORY):\nBefore generating, carefully study the provided reference image:\n1. Observe the PROPORTIONS — height-to-width ratio of the glass container.\n2. Observe the GEOMETRY — sharp 90° corners, flat sides, no curves.\n3. Observe the LABEL PLACEMENT — how it wraps around the front and sides.\n4. Observe the LID — thin, subtle gold metal cap.\n5. Observe the FILL LEVEL — powder stops below the neck with visible air gap.\n\nNow, with a fresh mind and the reference proportions internalized, proceed:\n\n---\n\nProduct photography of a single PREMIUM SQUARE GLASS JAR.\n\nGEOMETRY & FORM (STRICT):\n- The object is a PERFECT GEOMETRIC RECTANGULAR PRISM (like a glass brick).\n- 4 PERFECTLY FLAT vertical faces from bottom to top.\n- Corners are EXACT 90° breaks with near-zero radius — razor sharp edges.\n- NO rounding, NO facets, NO bevels, NO curves.\n- NOT cylindrical, NOT hexagonal, NOT decorative.\n- The camera view is a precise STRAIGHT-ON FRONT ELEVATION (Orthographic style).\n- The front face appears as a perfect square with no perspective distortion.\n\nLID:\n- Thin, subtle gold metal lid.\n- Lid height must be no more than 10% of total container height.\n- Must not dominate the silhouette.\n\nCONTENTS:\n- The jar contains [TEXTURE] matching hex color [HEX_CODE].\n- FILL PHYSICS: The powder settles naturally, stopping at the shoulder line.\n- HEADSPACE: A distinct, clean air gap is visible between the texture and the gold lid.\n\nLABEL MAPPING (SOURCE FIDELITY):\n- The provided image [LABEL_IMAGE_REFERENCE] is applied as a physical matte paper label.\n- WRAPPING PHYSICS: The label spans the full width of the front face. The label edges physically bend 90 degrees around the sharp corners and continue onto the side panels.\n- VISIBILITY: The \"Nutrition/Ingredients\" sections are on the side panels, foreshortened and turning away from the camera view.\n- TEXTURE: High-quality matte paper finish, not glossy.\n- HEIGHT: The label must NOT stretch to cover the full jar height. Visible glass/product should be above and below the label.\n\nLIGHTING & SCENE:\n- Background: Deep matte blue (#1a2744).\n- Lighting: Softbox top-left with \"Rim Lighting\" to define the sharp vertical glass edges.\n- Reflections: Clean studio reflections on the gold metal lid.\n\nAUTO-FAIL CONDITIONS (Regenerate if any occur):\n- Any curved glass profile\n- Label does not show sharp fold creases at corners\n- Powder reaches lid\n- Front face is not perfectly square\n- Container looks like a jar instead of a glass brick",
        "SQUAT_PET_JAR_TEMPLATE": "PROPORTIONS & LABEL COVERAGE (CRITICAL):\n- JAR RATIO: The jar is \"squat and wide\" (approx 1:1 aspect ratio), not a tall narrow tube.\n- LABEL HEIGHT: The label is a \"Central Band.\" It does NOT cover the whole jar height.\n- GAPS: There is a significant strip of clear plastic visible ABOVE the label (showing the powder) and a strip of clear plastic visible BELOW the label.\n- WRAP: The label wraps 360 degrees, disappearing around the curve.\nProduct photography of a single STANDARD CLEAR PET JAR with a blue lid.\n\nGEOMETRY & FORM (CYLINDRICAL):\n- The object is a standard cylindrical plastic food jar.\n- WALLS: The sides are perfectly vertical and round (Cylinder). \n- MATERIAL: High-clarity PET Plastic (Not glass).

        "TALL_PET_BOTTLE_TEMPLATE": "A photorealistic professional product photograph of a single tall, cylindrical clear PET plastic jar (proportions roughly 1.7:1 height to width) with a bright yellow opaque plastic screw-on lid, sitting centered on a clean white surface against a solid dark blue studio background.\n\nThe jar is filled with [TEXTURE] that has an approximate color matching hex code [HEX_CODE].\n\nAffixed centrally onto the curved front plastic surface is the exact label shown in [LABEL_IMAGE_REFERENCE].\n\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: The label is a horizontal strip (50mm tall) that is significantly shorter than the jar (160mm tall). There must be substantial visible space of clear plastic and powder both above and below the label. The label sits in the vertical center of the jar.\n\nCRITICAL WRAPPING: The label must wrap realistically around the cylinder. ONLY the central 40% of the label design (the main logo/title) should be visible on the front face. The left and right sides (nutrition facts, side text) MUST curve away and disappear from view. Do not squeeze the entire label onto the front face.\n\nThe lighting is professional studio softbox lighting from the top-left, creating a vertical specular highlight along the length of the cylindrical jar to emphasize its roundness. Eye-level view. Square aspect ratio.\n\nA rectangular matte paper label referenced from [LABEL_IMAGE_REFERENCE] is applied to the front face.\n\nFront Face: The label covers about 40% of the jar's circumference. It is clearly visible on the front face, but the edges curve slightly away from the camera. It does not wrap all the way around the sides.\nCurvature: The left and right edges of the label follow the cylinder's curve naturally."

            "final_prompt": "PROPORTIONS & LABEL COVERAGE (CRITICAL):\n- JAR RATIO: The jar is \"squat and wide\" (approx 1:1 aspect ratio), not a tall narrow tube.\n- LABEL HEIGHT: The label is a \"Central Band.\" It does NOT cover the whole jar height.\n- GAPS: There is a significant strip of clear plastic visible ABOVE the label (showing the powder) and a strip of clear plastic visible BELOW the label.\n- WRAP: The label wraps 360 degrees, disappearing around the curve.\nProduct photography of a single STANDARD CLEAR PET JAR with a blue lid.\n\nGEOMETRY & FORM (CYLINDRICAL):\n- The object is a standard cylindrical plastic food jar.\n- WALLS: The sides are perfectly vertical and round (Cylinder). \n- MATERIAL: High-clarity PET Plastic (Not glass). The walls are thin and transparent with realistic plastic refraction.\n- LID: A glossy COBALT BLUE screw-top lid. The side of the lid has a distinct vertical \"ribbed\" grip texture. The top of the lid is smooth.\n\nCONTENTS:\n- The jar contains coarse and a little chunky matching hex color #b35900.\n- FILL PHYSICS: The powder is visible through the clear plastic.\n- HEADSPACE: The fill level is approximately 85%, leaving a visible air gap between the powder and the blue lid.\n\nLABEL MAPPING (CURVED WRAP):\n- The provided image [Palli Kaaram.png] is applied as a physical paper label.\n- WRAPPING PHYSICS: The label wraps naturally around the CURVE of the cylinder.\n- VISIBILITY: The \"Teepi Gurtu\" logo and \"Telugu Delicacies\" branding are centered on the front curve.\n- FORESHORTENING: The text on the far left and right edges (Ingredients/Nutrition) curves away from the camera and becomes foreshortened/compressed by the perspective.\n- TEXTURE: Semi-gloss paper label finish.\n\nLIGHTING & SCENE:\n- Background: Clean white or light grey gradient to match a catalog style.\n- LIGHT SHAPING: A tall, vertical softbox highlight runs down the entire length of the left side of the cylinder (defining the round shape).\n- REFLECTIONS: Plastic-like gloss on the jar shoulder and the blue lid."
